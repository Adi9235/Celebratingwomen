This smart contract allows users to create crowdfunding campaigns, make contributions to active campaigns, cancel campaigns, refund contributions to contributors if a campaign is cancelled, and close successful campaigns. 

It uses a Campaign struct to store information about each campai gn, including the campaign creator, the goal amount, the current total amount of contributions, and the current state of the campaign.

It also uses a CrowdFunding struct to store a mapping of campaignkeys to Campaign structs in storage. The contract's call method provides entry points for each of the supported actions, and the contract's create method initializes the CrowdFunding struct with an empty campaigns storage.
